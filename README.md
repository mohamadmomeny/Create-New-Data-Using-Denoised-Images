## An Autoencoder Model to Create New Data Using Noisy and Denoised Images Corrupted by the Speckle, Gaussian, Poisson, and impulse Noise
The images, corrupted by the Speckle, Gaussian, Poisson, and impulse Noise, can be restored by image enhancement approaches such as deep autoencoder networks. The pixel values in the restored data (enhanced image) and the original noise-free image are not accurately equal, depending on noise density level. Here, the dissimilarity between restored and original pixels are used as a data augmentation approach. First, noise of given type and density is added to the data. Then, the noise is partially eliminated from the image by employing the deep convolutional autoencoder. The denoising deep convolutional autoencoder create the output (new data) from the noisy input, where the target is set as the original images. As a final point, the restored images are employed as new augmented data.
